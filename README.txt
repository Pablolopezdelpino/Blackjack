Blackjack application
@author Pablo Lopez del Pino (pablolopezdelpino@gmail.com)

To run:
Either compile using provided build.bat and run using run.bat
or
Use the provided maven POMs to build the modules (Cards -> Blackjack -> ConsoleUi)

The only requirement is java 1.8+.
The application has no dependencies, but you will need mockito and junit for running the tests.
